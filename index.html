                  Code Quests is a platformer game that makes learning code fun. Users play
                  as our female protagonist, K8 Bits, a nifty hacker on a journey to save
                  the world from an alien invasion, one code at a time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Along the way, K8 will encounter enemies, an army of octocats who
                  will 'share' their coding secrets upon defeat. With each new
                  fact she learns, K8 is one step closer to solving the coding
                  challenge that awaits at the end of the level.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Conquer the coding challenge and the portal gate opens, allowing passage
                  to the next level of the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Will you help K8 save the world?

                  representative of the females in the coding industry. We gave her a casual look and
                  a laptop as an accessory to emphasize the importance of one's skills.

                  that looked like what it is based on. We also wanted the style to match our own. Plus we
                  used Git a ton during this hackathon. Shout out to Octocat!

                  <b>Setting:</b> At first we had a greyish background because of the technology theme
                  we originally had in mind. But after seeing the world in action, it was very gloomy
                  and took the purpose of our game too literally. We then opted for a nature themed setting
                  to give off a more adventurous feel for our players to have while they're in the game.

## what it is
Code Quests is a platformer game that makes learning code fun. Users play
as our female protagonist, K8 Bits, a nifty hacker on a journey to save
the world from an alien invasion, one code at a time.

Along the way, K8 will encounter enemies, an army of octocats who
will 'share' their coding secrets upon defeat. With each new
fact she learns, K8 is one step closer to solving the coding
challenge that awaits at the end of the level.
